## __Git__

- Git이란

Git is a `free and open source` distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is `easy to learn` and has a `tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.` It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like `cheap local branching`, convenient `staging areas`, and `multiple workflows.`
